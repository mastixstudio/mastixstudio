# Regulatory Compliance: Mastering BCBS 239, IRRBB, BRRD, FRTB, and Beyond

## Regulations Requiï»¿re Robust Capabilities
To effectively comply with regulations such as **BCBS 239, IRRBB, BRRD, FRTB**[^1], and to successfully conduct reverse stress testing, financial institutions require 
robust capabilities. These capabilities include accurate data aggregation and reporting, precise valuations of assets and liabilities, comprehensive interest rate 
risk management, and the ability to simulate large numbers of consistent scenarios.


- #### Silos & Inconsistency Hinder Holistic Analysis:
  Financial institutions often grapple with legacy systems that were incrementally implemented for distinct risk types, leading to siloed and inconsistent calculations. Such an approach hinders a holistic view of risks and can pose challenges in meeting the broad requirements of regulations like BCBS 239, IRRBB, BRRD, and FRTB.

- #### Unlock Advanced Risk Calculations with MASTIX Studio: 
  As regulatory demands evolve, so must the computational capabilities of risk management tools. MASTIX Studio is engineered for this new era. With high performance and transparency at its core, it provides holistic valuations and risk calculations across the entire balance sheet.

- #### Integration Without Disruption: 
  Transitioning to a more modern risk management doesn't require a total system overhaul. Instead, it can be achieved by the strategic addition of potent tools into the existing framework. MASTIX Studio is ideally suited for this approach and offers a smooth, non-disruptive integration. Its adaptive design ensures that its computations contribute effectively to the bank's overall risk management architecture, making it powerful addition to any financial institution.
