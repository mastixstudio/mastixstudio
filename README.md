| :key:Differentiators            | :rocket:What MASTIX Studio Delivers  | :turtle:Typical Competitor Offerings |
|:----------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Consistency**                  | Values and risks anchored in a *singular cash flow and valuation framework*.              | Different valuations and risk measures calculated separately on time-consistent data.          |
| **High Performance**             | Full recalculation of *bank-wide metrics in minutes*. What-if calculations on any metric.             | *Overnight calculations of bank-wide metrics* such as LCR projections. Some incremental changes calculated intraday.  |
| **Holistic View of Risk**     | All valuations and risk metrics calculated *consistently across risk, reporting, and accounting.*       | Siloed calculations, *risk and accounting handled separately.*  |
| **Transparency**                 | Full traceability and detailed breakdown of every calculation. Comprehensive attribution analytics to track changes.                                            | Limited insight into calculations and no attribution functionality.  |
| **Modular Design**               | Accessible components that can be integrated or replaced as needed, ensuring *resilience and adaptability*.  | Modular in design for choosing internal components, yet often *lacking true flexibility* in external system integration.  |
| **Future-Proof Architecture**    | Architected for tomorrow with *AI-ready capabilities* and built to handle evolving regulatory demands.     | *Illusion of future-readiness with cloud setups*. Architecture not ready for substantial growth in requirements and lacks a foundational design for integration of AI and machine learning. |
